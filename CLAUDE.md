# themartiano

GitHub profile README repository for @themartiano (Eduardo Martinez).

## Structure

- `README.md` — Profile README rendered at github.com/themartiano
- `.github/workflows/snake.yml` — Generates snake contribution animation (runs daily, pushes SVGs to `output` branch)

## Design Guidelines

- **Minimal & clean** aesthetic — no badge soup, no clutter
- Use `<picture>` elements with `prefers-color-scheme` for dark/light mode support
- Tech stack icons via `skillicons.dev` with `theme=dark`
- GitHub stats via `github-readme-stats.vercel.app` with transparent background (`bg_color=00000000`)
- Snake animation via `Platane/snk` action (light + dark variants)
- Everything centered, consistent spacing with `<br>` tags and `---` dividers
